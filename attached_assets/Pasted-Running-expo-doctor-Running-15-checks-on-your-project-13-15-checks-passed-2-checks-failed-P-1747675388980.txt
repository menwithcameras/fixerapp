✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, scheme, primaryColor, notification, plugins. 

Advice:
Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

Advice:
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
