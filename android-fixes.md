# Android Fix Guide

This guide explains the fixes implemented to solve the white screen and broken icon issues on Android.

## Changes Made

1. **Image Approach Changed**:
   - Created programmatic icon rendering with React Native components
   - Eliminated dependency on external image files completely
   - Added SVG icon rendering directly in React Native code

2. **Entry Point Fixed**:
   - Modified `App.js` to use `App.expo.js` directly for better mobile compatibility
   - Added proper entry point detection for Android

3. **App.expo.js Enhanced**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling and crash prevention
   - Implemented global error boundary for uncaught exceptions
   - Added timeout handling with AbortController for better network reliability
   - Added proper status bar implementation with expo-status-bar

4. **Configuration Updated**:
   - Updated `app.json` with correct paths for Android adaptive icons
   - Changed splash screen background color to match app theme

## How to Build with These Changes

1. Use the updated `build-android-fix.sh` script before building
2. Run your Android build with the `--non-interactive` flag
3. These changes should resolve both the white screen and broken icon issues

## Testing the App

To verify the fixes worked:
1. Build the APK using EAS build
2. Install on your Android device
3. Verify the app launches properly with icons displayed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
- Make sure Expo has access to the PNG image files
- Verify your Android SDK and build tools are properly configured
- Check the logs during the build process for any asset bundling errors
