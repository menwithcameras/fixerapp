# Fixer App - Final Build Instructions

## Preparing for GitHub Integration Build

I've created all the necessary files and configurations for successfully building your Android app through GitHub integration:

1. **Pre-Android Build Script**
   - Run `./pre-android-build.sh` before pushing to GitHub
   - This creates all needed Android project files
   - Resolves the "capacitor.settings.gradle" missing error

2. **Key Configuration Files**
   - `app.config.js`: Preserves Android package name during builds
   - `metro.config.js`: Properly extends Expo's Metro configuration
   - `capacitor.settings.gradle`: Prevents Capacitor integration errors

## Building via GitHub

When you push your code to GitHub and connect with EAS:

1. The Android build will access all the required files
2. Your Stripe integration will continue to work through proper environment variables
3. Metro bundling will correctly process your JavaScript code

## Recommended Build Process

```bash
# 1. Run the pre-Android build script
./pre-android-build.sh

# 2. Commit all changes to Git
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Android build"
git push

# 3. Build with EAS
eas build --platform android --profile simpleBuild
```

## Verifying Your Build

After the build completes:

1. Download the APK from the link provided by EAS
2. Install on your Android device
3. Verify that the Stripe integration works properly
4. Check that location services function correctly
5. Test job posting and payment processing

## Future Updates

For future app updates:

1. Make your code changes as needed
2. Run the pre-Android build script again
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Build with EAS using the appropriate profile

The same build configuration will be used, ensuring consistent builds across updates.
