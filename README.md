## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Stripe account for payment processing
- Android SDK (for building mobile app)

### Mobile App Builds

You can build Fixer as a native Android application using our build script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x build-android.sh

# Run the build script
./build-android.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build the web application
2. Initialize or update the Android project
3. Build an Android APK file
4. Create a QR code for downloading the APK (optional)

The resulting APK will be available at `./fixer-app.apk` for installation on Android devices.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/the-job.git
   cd the-job
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create environment variables (see [Environment Configuration](./docs/environment-configuration.md)):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Development

- The frontend is built with Vite and React
- The backend uses Express
- Database interactions use Drizzle ORM
- The project uses a monorepo structure with shared types
