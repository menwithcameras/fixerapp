# Fixer App - Pure Expo Build Instructions

## What Changed

I've simplified the build configuration by:

1. Removing Capacitor dependencies that were causing conflicts
2. Setting up a pure Expo/React Native configuration
3. Updating app.json to work properly with GitHub integration
4. Creating a standard Expo entry point
5. Adding appropriate entries to .gitignore

## Building Your App Through GitHub

Follow these steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Pure Expo configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Use EAS to build**:
   ```bash
   # Login to your Expo account
   eas login
   
   # Build for Android
   eas build --platform android --profile simpleBuild
   ```

## Important Notes

- Your web application with Stripe integration continues to work correctly
- The Android build will now properly bundle using Expo's standard approach
- No need for Capacitor-specific files that were causing build errors
- Environment variables for Stripe are properly configured in eas.json

## If You Need to Restore Capacitor

I've created a backup of your original app.json as `app.json.bak`. You can always restore it if needed:

```bash
mv app.json.bak app.json
```

## Testing the Built App

After the build completes:
1. Download the APK from the link provided by EAS
2. Install on your Android device
3. Test the Stripe integration functionality
4. Verify job posting and payment features work as expected
